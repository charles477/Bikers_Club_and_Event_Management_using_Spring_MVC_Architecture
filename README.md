# Bikers_Club_and_Event_Management_using_Spring_MVC_Architecture

Project Overview
This project is a web application for managing bike clubs and events using the Spring MVC framework. It leverages various technologies and tools to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for users to create and manage bike clubs and events. The application employs MVC architecture, Spring Security for user authentication and authorization, Thymeleaf for the view layer, Bootstrap for styling, and MySQL for database storage.

Features
User Registration: Users can register by providing a username, email, and password.

Club Creation: Registered users can create bike clubs by providing a club name, photo URL for an image, and content for the club.

Event Creation: Club creators can add events by providing event details, including event name, photo URL, event type, start and end times, location, and a brief event description.

Edit and Delete Permissions: Users who created a club or event have the privilege to edit or delete it. The edit and delete buttons are visible only to the creator, while other users can only view the club or event.

Technologies Used
Spring MVC: The project follows the Model-View-Controller architecture, where the controller handles incoming requests, interacts with the model, and communicates with the view to render the user interface.

Spring Security: Provides login and security features, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities and protecting user data.

Thymeleaf: Used for creating dynamic views in HTML templates, making it easier to integrate server-side data into web pages.

BCrypt Password Encoder: Safely stores user passwords by hashing them using BCrypt, enhancing security.

MySQL: The application uses MySQL for the database to store user information, club details, and event data.

Bootstrap: Bootstrap is employed to style the layout, making the application visually appealing and responsive.

MVC Architecture
In this project, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern is used to separate the application into three interconnected components:

Controller
The Controller component serves as the intermediary between the views and the model. It is responsible for processing incoming requests, managing business logic, and interacting with the model. The controller doesn't directly handle data logic but instructs the model on what to do.

View
The View component handles all user interface (UI) logic. It generates the UI for users based on the data provided by the model. Views are created by the data collected from the model but only interact with the controller. The controller is responsible for providing data to the view.

Model
The Model component encompasses all data-related logic, including user data, club details, and event information. It handles the interactions with the database, such as adding, retrieving, or updating data. The model responds to the controller's requests by providing the necessary data.

By using this MVC architecture, the project achieves a clean separation of concerns, making the code more maintainable and allowing for future enhancements and scalability.
